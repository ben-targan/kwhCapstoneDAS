This is dbus-tools, a set of tools to have more fun with DBus :)
Home page (last version, documentation): http://code.google.com/p/dbus-tools

Installation:
 - copy dbus somewhere in your $PATH
 - copy _dbus in /usr/share/zsh/site-functions if you want ZSH completion for
dbus-cli. You can also add it somewhere into your $fpath, for example put it in
$HOME/.config/zsh/comp/_dbus and add fpath=(${HOME}/.config/zsh/rc/comp $fpath)
at the top of your .zshrc
